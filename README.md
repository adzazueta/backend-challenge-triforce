# Backend Developer Challenge: Triforce

Welcome to the challenge for the Backend Developer position! This README contains the challenge details and instructions for completing it.

## Project Description

The goal of this test is to assess your algorithmic, logical and mathematical skills. design and develop scripts. You are required to create a script that meets the following requirements:

1. **Triforce**: The Triforce is an iconic symbol in "The Legend of Zelda". It consists of three overlapping equilateral triangles that form a triangular pattern. Your task is to write a program that, given a positive integer n as input, draws the Triforce in the console with a size proportional to the value of n.

Here is an example of how the Triforce should look for n = 5:
